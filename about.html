		<h1>About Me</h1>

		<!-- <p>Allow me to tell you a little bit about myself. These are a few of my hobbies:</p>
		<ul id="about-me-list">
			<li>Watching baseball</li>
			<li>Playing video games</li>
			<li>Learning new vegetarian recipes</li>
			<li>Traveling to new cities</li>
		</ul> -->

		<h2>Background:</h2>
		<p> I grew up in Illinois, but have lived in several different states. I currently reside in Chattanooga, TN. <br>
			I have spent the last decade of my life between retail, freight operations, and emergency medical services. <br>
			I have developed a passion for the tech industry over the last few years by creating designs and <br>
			layouts for streamers. I have also dabbled at creating projects around front office managing in baseball. <br>
			I'm probably one of the few people you'll know who can say they've driven an ambulance and can also create <br>
			the program needed for a patient's medical records.  
		</p>

		<h2>What led me to becoming a web developer?</h2>
		<p> I like having the ability to create things. When I sat down and looked inward I wanted to work <br>
            in a field with room for growth creatively. I've always created my own projects and events and <br>
			learning to code has helped to improve this and expand my skill set. I also like the ability to work <br>
            independent as well as in teams. I like the flexibility to work from home or in an office space. <br>
			I've always been a "jack of all trades" type of person, but never knew anything about building <br>
			tech and websites until now. 
        </p>
    
		<h2>Goals & Aspirations:</h2>
		<p> My goal is continue to gain experience and grow as a developer. I hope to create my own projects one <br>
			day with collaboration from others to help in areas of sports, esports, and animal sanctuaries. I hope to <br>
			blend my passions together for the greater good. You can visit my portfolio at <a href="https://barget20.github.io/Portfolio_Website/"
