		<h1>About Me</h1>

		<h2><u>Background:</u></h2>
		<p> I grew up in Illinois, but have lived in several different states. I currently reside in Chattanooga, TN. <br>
			I have spent the last decade of my life between retail, freight operations, and emergency medical services. <br>
			I have developed a passion for the tech industry over the last few years by creating designs and <br>
			layouts for streamers. I have also dabbled at creating projects around front office managing in baseball. <br>
			I'm probably one of the few people you'll know who can say they've driven an ambulance and can also create <br>
			the program needed for a patient's medical records. I have a unique blend of management and coaching experience. <br>
			I'm a strong believer in "leaders." Leaders lead by example and set the tempo and standard of what is to be expected. <br>
			Also great leaders create new leaders by teaching and mentoring those around them. This is how strong teams <br>
			are built from within. I've been a part of both winning sports teams and productive groups.    
		</p>

		<h2><u>What led me to becoming a web developer?</u></h2>
		<p> I like having the ability to create things. When I sat down and looked inward I wanted to work <br>
            in a field with room for growth creatively. I've always created my own projects and events and <br>
			learning to code has helped to improve this and expand my skill set. I also like the ability to work <br>
            independent as well as in teams. I like the flexibility to work from home or in an office space. <br>
			I've always been a "jack of all trades" type of person, but never knew anything about building <br>
			tech and websites until now. 
        </p>
    
		<h2><u>Goals & Aspirations:</u></h2>
		<p> My goal is continue to gain experience and grow as a developer. I hope to create my own projects one <br>
			day with collaboration from others to help in areas of sports, esports, and animal sanctuaries. I hope to <br>
			blend my passions together for the greater good. You can check out my current Github projects at this <br>
