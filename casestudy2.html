            <h1>Holiday Soundboard Case Study</h1>
      
        <div class="text">
        <h2><u>Overview:</u></h2>
            <p>The Holiday Soundboard was built to create a variety of holiday sound bites by using a <br>
                javascript drumkit. I also included an extra webpage for kid sounds that a parent may utilize. <br>
                Currently this only works on a computer and not on mobile. 
            </p>

        <div class="text">
            <h2><u>Purpose & Context:</u></h2>
            <p>I was looking to create a new project that was simple and easy enough to digest for viewers. <br>
                I also was looking to learn new features I hadn't used before. This was my first time using <br>
                a drumkit with colored animation. After building up the Halloween sample page I realized I <br>
                could use this type of website to be used as a Streamdeck replacement that a streamer or <br>
                content creator could use.  
            </p>
            
            <h2><u>Objective</u></h2>
            <p>The objective was to build a fully functional website that could be used as a simple Streamdeck <br>
                replacement. A Streamdeck being a piece of hardware that streamers push to play certain sound <br>
                clips or video clips while they are streaming. Therefore each button that you push that is on the <br>
                soundboard will play a sound bite. In this case each profile is based on different holidays <br>
                and a kid friendly page. 
            </p>
        </div>

            <h2><u>Duration:</u></h2>
            <p>This project took 1-2 weeks for full completion. This includes a few styling adjustments <br>
                such as editing the colors of the animations behind the keys and proper text sizing. <br>
                I also had to search for sound clips, edit them down, and then host the site online to use. <br> 
            </p>

        <div class="text">
            <h2><u>"The How"</u></h2>
            <p>-An index.html file was created for our common webpage information. Initially only one soundboard <br>
                page was going to be created. Instead of creating multiple sites, it made more sense to create <br>
                multiple webpages/profiles. 
               
            </p>

        <div class="text">
            <p>-The heart of this project is matching the keys on the keyboard with the proper audio. To do this <br>
                we needed to create a working script to indicate that when I hit a data-key (A) that the matching <br>
                audio plays once it is hit ("Christmas Spirit" on Christmas). 
            </p>
        </div>

                <img src="img_/soundLines124_157.png" alt="data key scripts">
        </div>

        <div class="text">
            <p>-After everything was implemented and working properly it just needed to be spiced up a bit. <br>
                In styles.css I chose the colors for each webpage. The holiday text, the menubar colors change, <br>
                and the animation colors around the keys change. 
            </p>

            <h2><u>"Challenges"</u></h2>
            <p>The major challenges for this project was having to define each holiday characteristics with CSS. <br>
                I also had to decide to find shorter audio clips (or edit them down) because I couldn't find a fix for <br>
                double clicking to stop audio. I also know this does not work on mobile without a keypad. These are <br>
                a few things I will try to figure out in the future.
