            <h1>Streamer Portfolio Case Study</h1>

    <div class="text">        
            <h2><u>Overview:</u></h2>
            <p>The Streamer Portfolio was created as an alternative webpage that a streamer/ content <br>
                creator could use to show off all the important branding information they have. I <br>
                used myself as a sample demo. 
            </p>
    </div>

        <div class="text">

            <h2><u>Purpose & Context:</u></h2>
            <p>I wanted to learn some extra features using JavaScript. The click to reveal information <br>
                feature I found very fun and creative. Once I got that to work I realized I could use this <br>
                as a simple feature page for a streamer/ content creator. Most creators these days <br>
                use a linktree webpage. Other than changing the background color they are quite boring. I <br>
                wanted to increase the visual and interaction, as well as offering more than just links. 
            </p>
            
            <h2><u>Objective</u></h2>
            <p>The objective was to build a fully functional single webpage to show off a streamer/ content <br>
                creator's information that you might find on their Twitch, Linktree, or personal website. <br>
                At the same time I wanted to keep it simple enough to update and use. 
            </p>

            <h2><u>Duration:</u></h2>
            <p>This project took 1-2 weeks. I am not a designer by trade, so It took me a week to decide <br>
                on whether to keep the background images and style each font separately, or to just change <br>
                the background to a color when that specific panel is clicked on. Simplicity won out and I went with <br>
                a single color for each and a regular text style. 
            </p>

        </div>

        <div class="text">
            <h2><u>"The How"</u></h2>
            <p>-An index.html file was created and sorted into five panels. <br>
                -The functions were created to open the panels and define what it would look like when active. <br>
            </p>

                <img src="img_/panels1.png" alt="panels information">
                <img src="img_/panels2functions.png" alt="panel functions">
        </div>

        <div class="text">
            <p>-With the help of a Wes Bos project I used his default setup for creating the way the panels looked <br>
                and were shaped. I then moved that information into the styles.css file. <br>
                -Once everything was working properly I updated the text, background images, and stylings. As I <br>
                previously stated this took some time to adjust how I wanted the webpage to actually look like. <br>
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="screenshot">
                <img src="img_/panels3layout.png" alt="panels layout info">
                <img src="img_/panels4background_text.png" alt="background images & text styling">
                <img src="img_/panel5stylings.png" alt="additional stylings">
        </div>

        <div class="text">
            <p>-In the end I decided on a color, a different font type, and no background image when a panel is opened <br>
                I didn't want to make this project over complicated on the eyes. 
            </p>

            <h2><u>"Challenges"</u></h2>
            <p>The major challenges for this projects are mostly through design elements. There is a lot CSS stylings <br>
                that are involved. There is also a certain limit on the paragraphs you can put in each panel. If you <br>
                don't put them in the right order the title will be wrong. Even now the title is not perfectly even <br>
                with the rest. There was a lot of trial and error on this projects to get the right design. It is not <br>
                perfect, but this is only a sample project page. The spacing between links within a panel is also an <br>
                issue I could not seem to find a proper fix for. Instead I just kept it to one outgoing link per page. <br>
