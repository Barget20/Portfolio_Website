            <h2><u>Overview:</u></h2>
            <p>The JavaScript App was built to create a Pokedex full of Pokémon. It was integrated <br>
                with an already existing Pokémon database. Each Pokémon that you select you can see <br>
                the name, image, height, weight, and type. 
            </p>

            <h2><u>Purpose & Context:</u></h2>
            <p>This was a task that was a part of my web development course. I was introduced to features <br>
                such as modals, buttons, and grids. I also was introduced to jQuery and Bootstrap. I <br>
                further advanced my experience with stylings through CSS. 
            </p>
            
            <h2><u>Objective</u></h2>
            <p>The objective was to build a fully functional app that would allow users to browse through <br>
                Pokémon characters and receive their information. The aims of this project were to use a <br>
                pre-existing database and integrate it into this project.
            </p>

        <div class="text">
            <h2><u>Duration:</u></h2>
            <p>This project took 6-7 week for full completion. This includes a few styling additions and <br>
                issues. A few features were removed as well after trial and errors and not being necessary.
            </p>
            <h2><u>Credit:</u></h2>
            <p>Role: Lead Developer <br>
                Mentor: Andrew Mercer

        <div class="text">
            <h2><u>"The How"</u></h2>
            <p>-An index.html file was created for our common webpage information. <br>
                -scripts.js was created to test out our Pokémon features (button) and manual information <br>
                (inserted height, weight, etc) by using functions and promises. This was to see how the <br>
                project was looking and if it was functioning properly. <br> 
                -A Pokémon database was given to use. This was then implemented into the project by defining <br>
                it as apiUrl. Essentially just linking a database into the webpage we are building.

        </div>

        <div class="text">
            <p>-The parameters we wanted to show off from this API were defined. In this case the name of the <br>
                Pokémon, an image, its height, weight, and class type. This was defined under the functions <br>
                loadList and loadDetails.
            </p>
        </div>

        </div>

        <div class="text">
            <p>-After everything was implemented and working properly it just needed to spice it up a bit. <br>
                In styles.css how the buttons and the list looked were defined.</p>

            <h2><u>"Challenges"</u></h2>
            <p>The major challenges for this project were integrating a database into a project for the first <br>
                time while also trying to style the layout around it. It took some time to lose the bullet points <br>
                and structuring the page layout with grids. I also couldn’t quite get the search function to work <br>
                either. It wasn’t required and got scrapped. In the future I would like to go back and implement this.<br>
                Overall with help from my mentor we made this project fully functional.
